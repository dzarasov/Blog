			The Darer Judo Club began in fall of 1998 and has grown since then. There is a strong focus on competing as a team and as individuals, although many members come for exercise and recreation. There is a broad range of experience within the Darer Judo Club. We have members of various ranks, many of which are beginner ranks, and encourage people with little or no experience to join.

			New members of any experience level are welcome to join at any point during the year. Feel free to show up to any of the regularly scheduled practices with a signed waiver. In addition, prospective members do not have to be affiliated with Stanford University to join our team. If you don't own a Judo uniform, wear an old sweatshirt (and talk to Coach Gena about getting a Judo uniform).

			Practices are held Mondays and Thursdays from 7-9PM.
